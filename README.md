IoT Dima's Project

What is it?

Last report: april 4, 2016 Created by Hecton Paulino Domingos  

Dima's project is Internet of Things personal project with several sensors on arduino platform configured to monitor the environment around my son, Dimitri, and feedback via SMS (using SIM900 GSM module and ESP8266-e12 to access reall time data) if there is something wrong. The project is in development and I will update this page when I have progress.
Details

•IoT project in development to protect my 9 months old son, Dimitri.
•This device will monitor the environment around my son searching for something wrong such high level of dangerous gas, smoke, CO², fire and temperature.
•Also will be able to measure the light condition.
•If the level is not acceptable, it will send first a sound sigh, show the data on the oled display and send me a SMS via SIM900 GSM module.

•Will be 24hs accessible via internet, using ESP8266
Sensors
•Temperature - LM35
•Light - LDR
•CO² - MQ7
•LGP, smoke, inflammable gas. - MQ2
•Fire

 
Modules
•GSM900 shield
•Ethernet Module
•ESP8266

 
Arduino board
•Arduino Mega 2560 r3+
•In the first try, I used Arduino Uno compatible called Blackboard, from a Brazilian board. It has some advantages upon original, but I needed more IO ports to works with more sensors.

 
What I have done
•Bought the sensors
•Tested on Arduino Uno compatible
•Tested separately all shields
